# Simple Web Worker Tooling

Frankly, getting a web worker up and running in most of the default tools is a pain in the ass.

This is just a tiny little repo to get a pretty basic web worker up and running to start playing with the potential.

Hopefully, someone can point me to something much better soon, but for now this is it.

Unfortunately, I've been thus far unsuccessful in getting this to run on Code

If you too have thrown in the towl on something better, heres how you get started with this tiny frankenstein's monster.

`yarn install` or `npm install`

`yarn start` or `npm start`

`yarn build` or `npm build` (God forbid, this really wasn't a "go to production" build setup)

This was built for a post, where I will pretend to know what I'm talking about and encourage broader adoption of Web Workers.
